FRONTEND: 
Wavid: 
  worked with Rohan to create a method for the form submissions for account creation and login to be sent to backend to interact with database of user info. 
  created test cases for the form submit function in the login and register components
    These test cases are showing as pending, as they are awaiting a response from the backend which is not running during the "test" function
   Fixed some css/looks issues with the login and register pages
   created new system for object updating re: when people fill the form. This is so that it is easy to send backend the object as a JSON
