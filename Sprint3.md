Blake:
Created new test cases to ensure that all new features added within the backend were implemented correctly and work correctly given different test cases. Added testing to the new 'parseLogin', 'parseRegistry', 'queryByName' and 'queryByTags'. Each function that got testing has test cases that ensure that each of the status that should be returned are returned properly. For more information on the test cases added refer to the backend_readme file within the backend folder. To see the test cases and implementation of testing, refer to the 'main_testing.go' file within the backend folder.
